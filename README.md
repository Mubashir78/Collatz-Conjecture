## Collatz Conjecture Phenomenon in Mathematics
 The **Collatz Conjecture** *(also known as **3n+1**)* is a famous problem in Mathematics.
 
 It works on all positive integers and applies one of two rules to the given number. If the given integer is **even**, it is divided by 2. If, however, the integer is **odd**, it is multiplied by 3 and then summed with 1.
 
 All integers *(even and odd)* eventually come down to a loop which goes on indefinitely. That loop is the "**4**, **2**, **1**" loop. That is, all numbers end up in this loop eventually.
 
 The problem is that we do not know if all positive integers fall into this loop. The hope is to one day find a number that either goes onto infinity or makes another loop that is not the "**4**, **2**, **1**" loop.
 
 *This program is a demonstration of the problem for you people to interact with.*
